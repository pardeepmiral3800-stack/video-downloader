This PR fixes the health check endpoint that was failing on Railway deployment.

## Changes Made

- **Downgraded Express**: Changed from Express 5.x to 4.19.2 to resolve compatibility issues with Railway's deployment environment
- **Dynamic Port Binding**: Updated server.js to use `process.env.PORT || 5000` for proper port assignment in deployment
- **ES Module Conversion**: Converted index.js from CommonJS require() to ES6 import syntax
- **Health Check Script**: Added npm script for testing the health endpoint locally

## Testing

The health check endpoint now responds correctly with `{"status":"ok"}` when accessed via GET request to the root path "/".

## Deployment Notes

These changes ensure the application starts correctly on Railway and passes health checks required for deployment.
